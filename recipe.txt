        <h3>&nbsp&nbsp Sweet summer memories :</h3>
 
<p1>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy 2023 Summer memories are a bit different from those of my other 
   summers.I found muself an empty nester in the summer of <br>&nbsp2023. &nbsp&nbsp&nbspSCAAA....AAARY !&nbsp
   But I had been prepping myself to face the inevitable empty-nester phase of my life, for atleast 8 months<br>
   &nbspnow. So I had quite a bit of confidence about sailing through the transition into this 'empty-nester' phase.
   Boy ! did I get that wrong ???!!<br>&nbspThe 'empty-nester' phase hit me like a ton of bricks !&nbspInitially I had  made
   myself believe,that, a cheerful heart is good medicine to face any &nbspimpending problem in one's life.So I had
   gathered all the help .advice that I could get from my friends adn family members, who had been &nbspthrough the 'empty-nester" 
   phase of their life(SUCCESSFULLY) ! I've seen quite a few people who were not successful in sailing through<br>
   &nbsptheir empty-nester phase without any major catastrophe.So I had carefully decided to avoid the missteps they had
   made.And I had  collected &nbspadvice,hints, from the successful ones. All in all, I was quite confident, that, I
   had prepared myself to tackle the 'empty-nester' phase in my<br>&nbsp life as smoothly as I could.Simply put, I 
   was wrong ! I guess, no one could anticipate fully, the effect of 'empty-nester' phase . So I had to<br>&nbsp muster my
   strength, creativity, innovative skills to transition into this phase of my life ! All the preparations I had
   made, in anticipation of the<br>&nbsp 'empty-nester' phase did help ! I had to instinctively gather additional props,
   activities in addition to my preparations. And that's exactly, what<br>&nbsp&nbspI did in the summer of 2023 .<br><br>

        <h3>&nbsp&nbsp Strange summer experiences:</h3>
<p4><div>

<p1>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI did feel a bit strange as I relied a lot on my eldest daughter
  to help me ace through my 'empty-nester' phase. I am he mom and I had been<br>&nbsp used to taking care of her,until
  she got her own place and moved out after she secured a good-paying job.Now it seemed that she was caring
  <br>&nbsp for me like one cares for her child ! it was strange indeed !
